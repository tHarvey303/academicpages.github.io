Welcome to my website! If you haven't noticed already, my name is Thomas (Tom) Harvey! I'm a student studying Astrophysics, currently in the final year of my master's degree and (fingers crossed) soon to be embarking on a PhD. For the 4th year of my degree I am working at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://cfa.harvard.edu), which is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I study AGN feedback using Chandra and Hubble imaging and spectroscopy with [Dr. W. Peter Maksym](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~wmaksym/), as part of Dr. Pepi Fabbiano's research group.

Most galaxies are thought to contain a supermassive black hole at the center, and the evolution of the whole galaxy can be affected by the behaviour of this black hole. Understanding the relationship between black holes and galaxies is crucial for our understanding of how galaxies like our own have evolved! My current research focuses on NGC 5972, which is a spectacular galaxy with large double helix shaped clouds of ionised gas, as well as a small nuclear bubble containing a massive black hole (the AGN, or Active Galactic Nuclei). I am interested in the role of the AGN, jets and outflows in creating and sustaining these features. Learn more about my research [here](www.thomas-harvey.com/research).

I'm from the island of [Guernsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey), in the Channel Islands, which not many people have heard of. I've been very involved with the local astronomy club for many years, and much of my astronomical outreach, including articles, talks, radio and TV interviews has been through them. You can find out more about my outreach [here](https://www.thomas-harvey.com/outreach).

I edit and write articles for La Societe Guernesiase Astronomy Section, both for the website and the newsletter. You can find them [here](http://www.astronomy.org.gg/).
I am an amateur astrophotographer, so you should be able to find some pictures I've taken personally [here](http://wwww.thomas-harvey.com/coolstuff/). (suprisingly few astronomers can still say that!). 

This website is a continual work in progress, but you should find information on my current research, previous projects, outreach and science communication, other and other random blog posts.
