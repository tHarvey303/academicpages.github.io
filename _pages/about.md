Welcome to my website! If you haven't noticed already, my name is Thomas (Tom) Harvey! I'm a student studying Astrophysics, currently in the final year of my master's degree and (fingers crossed) soon to be embarking on a PhD. For the 4th year of my degree I am working at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://cfa.harvard.edu), which is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I study AGN feedback using Chandra and Hubble imaging and spectroscopy with [Dr. W. Peter Maksym](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~wmaksym/), as part of Dr. Pepi Fabbiano's research group.

My current research focuses on NGC 5972, which is a spectacular galaxy with large double helix shaped clouds of ionised gas, as well as a small nuclear bubble containing the AGN. Learn more about my research [here](www.thomas-harvey.com/research)
This website is a continual work in progress, but you should find information on my current research, previous projects, outreach and science communication, other and other random blog posts.

I edit and write articles for La Societe Guernesiase Astronomy Section, both for the website and the newsletter. You can find them [here](www.http://www.astronomy.org.gg/)

I am an amateur astrophotographer, so you should be able to find some pictures I've taken personally (suprisingly few astronomers can still say that!).
