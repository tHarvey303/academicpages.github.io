<h3>Astrophotography </h3>

I'm a keen amateur astrophotgrapher, and I enjoy photographing deep sky objects like galaxies and nebulae. My current setup consists of a William Optics Redcat 51 telescope, a ZWO ASI 533MC-PRO camera, mounted on a iOptron CEM25-EC mount. Most of the processing is done in Pixinsight.

You can find a non-exhaustive collection of some images I've created, or collected the data for. Where indicated the editing was done by other people, including Jean Dean and Anthony Nel.


<h4>Comet Neowise, <i>August 2020</i> </h4>

Comet Neowise was my first oppurtunity to photograph a comet that was visible to the naked eye. This photo was taken using a Canon 1100D and a 100mm f2.8 prime lens, mounted to a CEM25 mount. It is the sum of 29 150 second exposures, with the stars including from half of them. Due to the differeing motion of the comet and the background stars, the comet and the stars were seperated and processed seperately before being recombined.

Comets and lumps of ice and rocks left over from the formation of the solar system. They spent most of their time out beyond the orbits of the planets, in the Kuiper Belt and beyond, but their highly eccentric orbits sometimes bring them into the inner solar system. The heat from the Sun sublimates gas from the surface of the comet, creating tails which can stretch for a million miles! You can see 2 tails here, the blue straight one is the ion tail, which is made up of charged gas that are accelerated by the Sun's magnetic field and always points away from the Sun. The curved dust tail is made up of dust from the coma, which is the large "atmosphere" surrounding the comet due to the sublimation of the gas. 

<h4>Heart Nebula <i>Sept 2019</i></h4>

Thisimage of the Heart Nebula consists of 14 400s exposures, using a Canon 60Da and a Skywatcher Esprit 80ED with field flattener. The first one is edited by yours truly, and the second is the same data edited by Jean Dean, a more experienced astrophotographer and editor. You can see the difference practice makes in this hobby, and how much inidivudal style can come into it.

The Heart Nebula is an <i>emission nebula</i>, which simply means it is a cloud of gas that emits its own light! Some nebulae are instead reflection nebulae, which as the name suggests reflect light from another source such as a nearby star. <i>Dark Nebulae</i> are only seen by their outline blocking light from stars behind them. Some of the darker regions of the Heart Nebula are actually dust lanes where dust is obscuring the light.
