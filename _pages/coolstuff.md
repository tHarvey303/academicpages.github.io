<h3>Astrophotography </h3>

I'm a keen amateur astrophotgrapher, and I enjoy photographing deep sky objects like galaxies and nebulae. My current setup consists of a William Optics Redcat 51 telescope, a ZWO ASI 533MC-PRO camera, mounted on a iOptron CEM25-EC mount.

You can find a non-exhaustive collection of some images I've created, or collected the data for. Where indicated the editing was done by other people, including Jean Dean and Anthony Nel.
