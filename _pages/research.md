<h4> AAS Abstract </h4>

<h5> Signatures of AGN feedback in the spectacular extended emission line region of NGC 5972 </h6>

<i>T. Harvey, W. Maksym, W. Keel</i>


Large clouds of ionised gas far from AGN, known as Extended Emission Line Regions (EELRs), promise a novel tool for getting a handle on the kiloyear timescale behavior of AGN accretion. These clouds are often considered as quasar light echoes, because their emission states can encode the AGN luminosity history over the past 100,000 years. AGN with current luminosity below the required luminosity to ionise the EELR are known as "fading AGN". However sometimes they can be spoofed by an obscured AGN with high column density, which are themselves important laboratories for studying AGN feedback. NGC 5972 contains the most extended known EELR and was thought to be a faded AGN, but new x-ray luminosity estimates from NuSTAR and Chandra observations suggest a higher bolometric luminosity consistent with no recent fade in AGN output. 

We will present a new analysis of 3 Chandra observations of NGC 5972, totalling 50ks, which take advantage of Chandra's sub-arcsecond angular resolution to analyse spectra, luminosity and potential spatial distribution of hot gas within the galaxy. By comparison to Chandra PSF simulations we determine that the soft (< 3keV) emission are spatially extended and show correlation with the HST [OIII] features, including the galaxy-scale EELR and an arcsecond scale nuclear bubble. We are investigating the role of the AGN, jets and possible winds in exciting these features. This will help us understand the processes that can falsify fading AGN via EELRs, and allow us to reexamine the “light echo” luminosity history of this galaxy. This work is supported by Chandra grant GO8-19096X.
