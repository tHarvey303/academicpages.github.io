This project was a design proposal for a > 10 keV x-ray telescope. It was supposed to be a group project conducted over a single week in Tenerife, but due to the Covid pandemic the trip was cancelled and the project became an individual report. 

<h3>Executive Summary </h3>


![XBEX](http://www.thomas-harvey.com/images/xbex/design.PNG)

XBEX is a hard x-ray all-sky survey mission that will be sensitive across the 10-300keV range for imaging
and spectroscopy. It will primarily investigate the x-ray background, with the mission of resolving many
more of the individual sources that contribute to its non-stellar continuum. XBEX will catalogue an order of
magnitude more AGN, including Compton-thick AGN, than it’s predecessors, including the Swift and IN-
TEGRAL telescopes. In their all-sky surveys, Swift has observed around 1600 hard x-ray sources (Oh et al.,
2018) and INTEGRAL has discovered around ∼1000 emitting objects (Bird et al., 2016), whereas XBEX
is expected to catalogue over 10,000 extragalactic sources during its 3 year survey, including between 700
and 2000 new Compton-thick AGN. XBEX has 4x times better continuum sensitivity than INTEGRAL or
Swift across its energy range.

XBEX will conduct the most unbiased survey of the deep extragalactic sky, and will identify many more
Compton-thick AGN at intermediate redshift, allowing investigation of the true proportion of AGN that
are Compton-thick, and whether this proportion changes with redshift, which would have a large impact
on theories of AGN evolution and the link between AGN and their galaxies. XBEX will also watch for
new transient sources, and allow us to more accurately study new classes of object, such as x-ray bright
optically normal galaxies (XBONGS). The science payload consists of a coded mask telescope, using a
square twin-prime uniformly redundant array (URA), which has the benefit of having a delta-function for
its point spread function, rather than the noisy sidelobes associated with a random mask. The detector is
comprised of 4445 1.5 x 1.5 x 1cm CZT crystals, each of which is subdivided into 225 “virtual” 0.1 x 0.1
cm pixels, which will make XBEX the first megapixel hard x-ray telescope with a total detector area of
10, 000cm 2 . This massive step up in the number of detector crystals is due to recent advances in the growth
of CZT crystals, and the development of very power-efficient readout electronics. The use of a large number
of small pixels makes it possible to have a large detector area, which allows for good sensitivity, while the
small pixel size means the detector has high spatial resolution, which means this telescope has a much better
angular resolution and point source location accuracy than its predecessors. XBEX will have an angular
resolution of 3.4’, and a PSLA of 14”. The half coded field of view of the telescope will be ∼36 ◦ by ∼36 ◦ ,
and the telescope will observe the whole sky every ∼48 hours.

The mission will also have a secondary payload of a soft x-ray telescope, which will perform compli-
mentary observations in the 0.5 - 10 keV energy band, including characterising the the column density of
the AGN observed in the hard x-ray band, and observing the 6.4keV fluorescent iron line, which is another
indicator of obscured AGN.

XBEX will launch in late 2027 on an Ariane 6.2 mission from Kourou, French Guiana, as part of a
ridesharing mission, and will go into an low equatorial (i= 0 ◦ ) orbit at around 600km. This orbit will afford
the spacecraft protection from some cosmic rays by being inside the Earth’s magnetic field, while also being
high enough to remain in orbit for its nominal 5 year mission without excessive orbital decay and mostly
avoid the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The science payload has a mass of ∼3560kg. The 5 year mission
will consist of a 3 year all-sky survey, and 2 years of specific pointings and time for guest observers.
